Question: Why did I not receive my cashback?
Answer: There are couple of reasons on why you did not receive your cashback:
1. Using coupons, you found outside of CASHBACKS.AI. Using or even attempting to use any coupon codes, offers or promotions that are not on CASHBACKS.AI can void your Cash Back. There could be conflicts between Cash Back and the discounts offered by other coupon sites, exclusive emails, or rewards programs.
2. Visiting other sites during your shopping session. Going to other sites, especially ones that offer shopping rewards, coupons, or discounts, can result in the store giving the credit for your purchase to another site. In addition, browser extensions from other shopping programs (such as Honey or Invisible Hand) can interfere with linking your purchase to your CASHBACKS.AI account that is connected to RewardAny platform.
3. Switching to a different browser window or tab. You should only use the initial tab opened for you by CASHBACKS.AI at the beginning of your shopping session. If you complete your purchase in a different tab or window, we may be unable to link your purchase to your CASHBACKS.AI account that is connected to RewardAny platform.
4. Waiting too long after activating Cash Back to complete your purchase. Additionally, some stores do not allow us to link a purchase to your CASHBACKS.AI RewardAny account if items were added to your shopping cart before you activated Cash Back. It’s best to activate Cash Back before adding items to your cart and check out as soon as you can.
5. Ineligible store categories or products. Some stores limit Cash Back to certain categories or products. You may have purchased an item that’s not Cash Back eligible. To see a store’s eligible categories, check its store page on our site or in our App.

Question: How do I make sure that I can earn cashback?
Answer: To make sure you earn you cashback, you should make sure:
1. DO enable cookies on your browser while you are shopping.
Merchants use cookies to track your purchases so you can get Cash Back from CASHBACKS.AI! Remember, if the merchant doesn't track your purchase, CASHBACKS.AI does not receive a sales commission, which means we can't pay you the Cash Back.
2. DO click to visit the merchant's website from CASHBACKS.AI.
Clicking CASHBACKS.AI from other websites or typing the merchant's website directly into your web browser without going through CASHBACKS.AI will invalidate your Cash Back. Make sure that you don't click any other links to the merchant's website after clicking through from CASHBACKS.AI.
3. DO make sure your shopping cart is empty when you click to the merchant's website from CASHBACKS.AI.
In order to earn Cash Back, some merchants require that your shopping cart is empty when you click from CASHBACKS.AI to the merchant's website. Some merchants keep track of when you put items in your shopping cart and if you don't do it after you clicked from CASHBACKS.AI, it's possible that you won't earn Cash Back.
4. DON'T delete cookies while you are shopping.
We know that some people occasionally delete their browser cookies. Unfortunately, if you happen to delete cookies while in the middle of a CASHBACKS.AI shopping session, the Cash Back will not be tracked. Wait until after all of your shopping is complete before you consider deleting cookies.
5. DON'T close the store website while shopping.
If you do close the window, you must go back to the CASHBACKS.AI merchant page and click from CASHBACKS.AI to start a new session.
6. DON'T checkout multiple times at an online merchant without clicking back through CASHBACKS.AI.
If you want to keep shopping after checking out the first time, you must go back to CASHBACKS.AI and then click back to the merchant again. Even if you are ordering the same item at the same merchant but in a new order, you need to have a new record of clicking through to the merchant to go with your new order. So after every checkout, go back to CASHBACKS.AI to start again and click back to the same store or select a new store.
